This project consists of an intuitive user interface and a common abstraction to a series of seamless cloning tools for **auto-magically creating photomontages**. For now, it implements the algorithm presented in ["Poisson Image Editing" (SIGGRAPH 2003)](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=882269), but could easily accommodate other tools. This project was started as a term project for the GTI664 class at [\_École de Technologie Supérieure\_](http://www.etsmtl.ca) in Montréal, Canada.

The current implementation uses [MTJ (Matrix Toolkits for Java)](http://ressim.berlios.de/) for sparse matrix manipulations and [runs computations for each RGB channel concurrently (through the java.util.concurrent APIs)](http://code.google.com/p/poissonimageediting/source/browse/trunk/libphotomontage/src/ca/etsmtl/photomontage/poisson/PoissonPhotomontage.java). It is particularly efficient on multicore systems. There are currently some known issues with the way we deal with masks. The examples below show some artifacts caused when the mask is unstable (high energy along the boundaries). These issues are addressed in "Poisson matting"-type techniques. If you have interest in helping us to integrate this and possibly implement totally genuine algorithms, please contact us !
